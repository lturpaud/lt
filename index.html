  <p class="bodytext">When I first chose to make an anthology about Afghanistan, I was lead to believe, mainly by the American media, that Afghanistan was a war torn nation. I believed that the nation was ruled by the Taliban, and I saw the Taliban as the face of the country. I saw the Afghan people in a bad light, because the media had equated Afghanistan with the Taliban. However, I never saw the other side of Afghanistan, the damages of decades of war and violent conflict.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This came into light when I watched the film Osama, directed by Siddiq Barmuk. The film takes place in Afghanistan, under the rule of the Taliban. In the film, a girl must disguise herself as a boy in order to work and support her family. If she is caught, it most certainly means death. The film addresses the reality of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban, vividly depicting the horrible situation for women, and the poverty that ravaged the war torn nation. Osama was shot in the streets of Kabul, in 2003. This allowed Barmuk to portray the devastation that had struck Afghanistan for decades. Houses were torn down, and people lived in shacks. I realized that behind the Afghanistan that is on the news, there were people, living under an oppressive fundamentalist regime. There was a war torn nation, that had experienced violent conflict for decades, and that was working to rebuild itself. To add on, Osama depicted the hardships of life under the oppressive Taliban, especially for women and girls, showing the humanity side of Afghanistan, one that I had not seen before. By watching Osama, I was able to gain an insight into what Afghanistan was like, and is like, for normal civilians, a side that I was never able to see by simply consuming American media about the Taliban.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was especially exemplified by Khaled Hosseini’s A Thousand Splendid Suns. The novel tells the story of two girls, Miriam and Laila, separated by one generation, growing up in Afghanistan. Unexpectedly, they are brought together by the horrors of war. The novel illustrates the transition from a relatively prosperous nation to one ruled by the Taliban and Shari’a law. Hosseini shows the other side of Afghanistan. He illustrates both the religious conservatives, but also the more liberal, more modern Afghanis. Hosseini’s book, depicting life before the Taliban, paints the Afghan people in a brighter light than what I originally thought, although still vividly portraying darker aspects of traditional Islamic cultures, such as forced marriages. However, his book showed that most people in Afghanistan were not fundalmentalist warlords, vying for power. His book mentions the love of a child and her friend for the Buddhas of Bamyan, a symbol of ancient Afghan culture; they were blown up by the Taliban, causing international outcry. The book also mentions an artist who painted pants onto his painting of flamingos, just to wash it off later, as the Taliban would not allow the flamingos’ legs be shown. Hosseini’s book changed my understanding of the Afghan people. By following the rollercoaster lives of Miriam and Laila, their hardships, their living conditions, their coerced marriages, and their beatings by their abusive husband, A Thousand Splendid Suns portrays the part of Afghanistan that many in the west don’t see, the lost relationships, the reality of war on civilians, the personal effects of a traditionalist interpretation of islam, and the destruction of the arts and culture. Although A Thousand Splendid Suns was fictitious, and did not follow the life of any real person, it still changed my understanding of the people of Afghanistan, the people who did not support fundalmentalist Islam. I was able to grasp their culture, and the influences of Islam on their people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Afghanistan has been, historically, a country whose land has been repeatedly invaded and contested over. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the British, attempting to negate Russian influence, attempted to invade Afghanistan multiple times, once in 1839, in 1878, and in 1919. All three Anglo-Afghan wars ended in a British retreat. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, sparking a proxy war with the United States, leading to the creation of the Mujahadeen, jihadist “freedom fighters,” who were granted weapons and supplies by the United States to help them fight the Soviet Union. When the Mujahideen won the war against the Soviet Union, conflicts arose between the different ethnic groups and factions that had been united under one common enemy, leading to a four years long civil war. The Taliban, a radical jihadist terrorist organization, seized control of Afghanistan in 1996, beginning their reign of terror for 5 years. The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, sparking yet another brutal war that still continues on today, 18 years later.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both Barmuk’s film, Osama, and Hosseini’s novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, vividly depicts this history, in a fictitious story-telling manner. In both works, the motif of oppression is prevalent. From Osama’s depiction of the Taliban scattering women protesting for work, to the forced marriage of Miriam in A Thousand Splendid Suns, oppression against women weaves itself in many different forms into both stories.  The recurring theme in both stories is that when fighting for the rights of an oppressed community, sacrifices must be made, even if that means sacrificing one’s life. In Osama, the girl who disguises herself as a boy, must risk her life in order to provide for her family. In A Thousand Splendid Suns, Miriam must make a difficult sacrifice in order to save Laila from the Taliban. This connects to the hardships that people in Afghanistan faced during decades of invasions and suppression, showing the other side of Afghanistan, the non-violent, humane side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">My change in perspective can be seen when I first read one of two Pashtun short stories, The Solution, by Abdul Wakil Sulamal. My preconceived notion was that the short story would be catered towards more conservative, islamic, ideals. Although these discriminatory parts of Pashtun, Afghan, culture, plays a role in the events of the story, The Solution speaks about a girl, Gulalay, who’s father allegedly had ties with America, asking the minister to help her save her father from potential death. The minister forces Gulalay into a marriage, claiming that a stronger tie to her family will help him save her father. The Solution shows the theme that sometimes, tough sacrifices must be made for familial gains. The theme relates to many western themes, and the story is very similar to many western stories, with an Afghan twist, showing a woman coerced into a marriage, and the hatred of America and the west. This changed my view on Afghan culture, as I realized that the ideas, and insights on life, of Afghan people did not differ much from the west, despite being ruled by jihadist groups for 5 years.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Lastly, when creating this anthology, what surprised me the most, and what changed my perspective the most, was the Afghan poetry that I read. There was a wide variety of ideas in Afghan poetry, ranging from the destruction of America, to the pain of living in a country repeatedly colonized. However, a recurring theme in most of the poetry included in this anthology is that the loss of one’s country and one’s people can lead to great pain felt within oneself, and a calling to stand up and defend one’s culture. This can be seen in the poem, “O Afghan!” by Mohammed Nabi Kamran. Kamran’s poem is a calling to all Afghan people, asking them to fight against the enemy, to protect their nation. Afghanistan has been, historically, a country repeatedly invaded, and Kamran’s poem is crying out, to himself, and to Afghan people, to defend their homeland. Often times, one forgets that Afghanistan has, historically, been repeatedly colonized, and only see the conflicts in Afghanistan, but after reading Kamran’s poem, I realized that many Afghan people fight back against colonizing powers because they want to protect their nation, and their ethnic group, such as the Mujahideen fighting back against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The consequences of losing one’s nation is expressed in “I Live in Flames” by Abdul Basir Watanyar. Watanyar’s poem is one of mourning, speaking about the pain and the tragedy of having one’s nation constantly invaded, and the destruction of one’s traditional way of life. It speaks the theme that the loss of one’s country and one’s people can lead to great pain felt within oneself, and the loss of one’s soul.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both “White House” by Ahmadi, and “I Tell This to Bush” by Ezatullah Zawab directly attack and call out the enemy, which, in both poems, was the United States of America. The two poems were interesting, because, being an American, I disagreed with the ideas of the poem, and I was surprised by the threats that Ahmadi made against the White House, a symbol of American freedom. However, both poems reference the destruction of Afghanistan, and the collapse of their traditional Islamic culture, linking both to a hatred of the United States. The theme of both poems is that in the past, those wielding power have colonized and destroyed oppressed peoples, and that justice must be garnered for the cultures that were demolished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These poems are most likely responses to the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, which was the second invasion that Afghanistan saw within only a quarter century. These poems are reacting to intervention in their homeland by a foreign power, yet again. Although I disagree with the ideals of the poets, and I disagree with the topics of the poems, I believe that these poems are important to the anthology because they enhance the meaning of Afghanistan, and they show how the people of Afghanistan, who are fighting back against the United States, feel about another invasion of their country.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Lastly, “Sunset” by  Abdul Hai Mutma’in really changed my opinion of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Unlike the other poems in this anthology, “Sunset” is a poem that connects more with nature, like many older, more traditional poetry, despite being written by a member of the Taliban. It shows that the Taliban is human too, and that they also share the same feelings about nature that many of us do. The theme is that when the spirit leaves, everything dies, and this theme connects to me too, as many things only live on if the spirit survives.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Through making this anthology about Afghanistan, I have come to know the people, and the culture, better. I was able to see what the destruction of war was like, and I gained a better understanding about the hardships of women living in a traditionalist, Islamic, society. I also was intrigued by the poetry that the Taliban wrote, despite the warlike behavior that the media portrays. I believe that this anthology is important because it paints Afghanistan differently that many western sources. It shows the people of Afghanistan, who they really are. It even shows a different side of the Taliban, who believe in jihadist ideals, showing their pain, their hatred, and their bond to the spirit and nature.</p>
