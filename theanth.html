<p class="bodytext">As the music began to play, the minister quickly took Gulalay’s hand. He said: “Let’s have this dance!” Gulalay sobbed, but relentlessly started dancing. </p>
<p class="bodytext">The minister was surprised, and didn’t hesitate to console Gulalay. “You have been married. There is no need to worry about any other troubles.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay quickly interjected: “But I had no choice. My father was taken away. Taken away despite all that I have given to you. You promised me.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister was quick to defend himself. “My wife, don’t weep, for some promises must be broken. It is impossible not to break them.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay look at the floor, responding immediately: “You made me give you everything. I joined the Democratic Youth Association. I worked hard. I never slacked off. I showed up everyday and did my best. Now I have given you my life, bound by marriage.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister parted the hair covering Gulalay’s face, replying: “Marrying me is the best decision of your life, honey. All will be well.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay sobbed loudly over the music, but was quick to contradict: “But my father is not here at my wedding. You know where he is. Where is he?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister was taken aback, but was able to reply: “I feel offended. I would never hide anything from you. I would never lie to you, my wife. Your father shall be returned to you.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay stopped dancing, throwing the minister off balance. She quickly mumbled: “I want my father back. He was not an anti-revolutionary. He was taken by your people.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister was puzzled, but sternly replied: “Why did you stop dancing, my wife? The music has not stopped yet. Tomorrow I shall go to the party leadership, and beg that my father-in-law, your father, is to be released immediately!” 
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay refused to dance, but was quick to accuse: “I should have known that you are nothing but a trickster! I gave you my whole life, but you have not given me my father.” She collapsed to the floor, and she was weeping. All the attendees of the wedding turned toward the bride.
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister was shocked, but still tried to comfort her. “Tomorrow I shall go get your father back. Let’s forget all this business, and enjoy the dance of our lives.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay interrupted him. “But I was promised my father last week!”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister smiled. “Honey, don’t you understand? Some promises are impossible to keep.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Hoisted back to her feat by the minister, Gulalay quickly replied: “I want my father back! What more do you want from me?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Without hesitating, the minister replied: “There is nothing more that I want from you. You have given your life to me. Tomorrow I shall go back to the party leadership and demand for the return of my father-in-law.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay was bewildered. “He’s only your father-in-law because you promised his freedom!”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister chuckled. “And I will ensure that he gets his freedom. You agreed to this too.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay broke down into tears. “Please. Please, I beg of you. Return me my father!”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister quickly formulated his response. “Your father studied abroad, correct?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay was quick to reply: “Yes, in America.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister was not happy that his father-in-law had ties with America. “Why America? The land of western imperialist bigots! This is why he had not been released.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay interjected. “But you said he would still be released.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister said: “But he was in America, of all places!”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay asked: “So did I throw away my life in this marriage?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister quickly replied: “No, honey. Absolutely not. We need a new solution.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay sobbed. “What solution do you have?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister pondered the question for a while, then replied: “This solution must show proof of our legal relationship, and the one between you, me and your father.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay looked up, then said: “You want me to join you…”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister smiled. “Exactly, you shall join me in helping free you father.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay looked confused. “But how?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister quickly replied: “Simple. We shall go to the party leadership tomorrow, as a couple.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay sobbed again. “They’ll never listen to me!”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister encouraged Gulalay. “You are a member of the Democratic Youth Association. I am married to you. They have to listen to you, and me.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">Gulalay was quick to conclude: “First thing tomorrow morning we shall have my father released.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister replied: “Yes. Prepare your best impression. Tomorrow we shall go together to the party leadership and demand for the release of your father. Now let’s dance.”

	</p><p class="bodytext">*               *              *
	</p><p class="bodytext">The minister picked up the phone and called the party leadership. “Execute him.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The person on the other side was quick to question. “Who?”
	</p><p class="bodytext">“The American. I suspect he is an anti-revolutionary spy.”
	</p><p class="bodytext">The other side quickly responded: “Yes. We shall have him killed as soon as possible.”

	<h1>Film Review</h1>
</div>
<div> <p class="bodytext">Filmed in 2003, “Osama” takes place in Taliban controlled Afghanistan. The story line is very similar to Disney’s “Mulan.” After the Taliban shuts down a hospital, a girl, her mother, and her grandma, loses their source of income. The girl’s father and uncle both were killed in the wars that ravaged Afghanistan. Just like “Mulan,” the girl must disguise herself as a boy in order to get a job and help her family, because the Taliban prevented women from working. When the Taliban begins to conscript boys to help wage Jihad, the girl, disguised as a boy, is roped in. She is taken to a Taliban training camp for boys, where she runs the risk of being found out, which would result in her execution.</p>

When the Taliban begins to conscript boys to help wage Jihad, the girl, disguised as a boy, is roped in. She is taken to a Taliban training camp for boys, where she runs the risk of being found out, which would result in her execution.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Osama” is a very notable film, as it was the first to be filmed entirely in Afghanistan after the Taliban banned the production of films in 1996. It had a budget of only $46000. It was filmed on site in Kabul, Afghanistan. All the actors were people Barmak found off the street, and many of them couldn’t read. This meant that the script was either dictated to them, or it was improvised by the actors and actresses. This probably allowed the budget to be very low. However, since many of the lines were improvised, it brings into question if the English subtitles were based off the script, or based off what the actors said. Also, the actors could’ve used colloquial slang which may not translate perfectly into English due to cultural differences.
</p>
	<p class="bodytext">Although the actors weren’t good, and the production quality of the movie lagged way behind today’s movies, it gave an authentic insight into the reality of the reign of terror imposed by the Taliban. At one point, the girl’s legs are bleeding. However, the fake blood used was really obvious, unlike modern movies today, where it is almost indistinguishable. Despite a low budget, and therefore production quality, there was still efforts to give the film a certain, empty, sad, feeling. During the scene where the girl is getting her hair cut for her disguise, the film cuts between a medium close up shot of the girl’s grandma, and a crane shot of the girl, lying down. The score is empty; there is no background music, and the grandma is telling a legend that if a girl walks through a rainbow, she can change her gender, and become a boy.
</p>
	<p class="bodytext">The film also uses many different, odd, camera angles. When the girl, disguised as a boy, Osama, is suspended in a well as punishment for climbing a tree at the Taliban training camp, there is a low angle shot, with a very long take. The camera is looking up at Osama from the bottom of the well, under her. This makes it hard to see much of anything inside the well, and also provides a sense of what Osama felt like, as she could not see anything above ground. There is no background music. Only the faint sound of boys reading the Koran and praying can be heard in the background. This provides a sense of loneliness for the audience, as the audience is stuck too, inside the well, and because of the long take, it feels like forever. It helps the audience dive into the feelings of Osama, even though it is not using a subjective shot. Barmak does this really well. He is able to incorporate the mood and feeling of the characters, the setting, and the overall movie, all with amateur actors, improvised scripts, and a very low budget. 
</p>
	<p class="bodytext">Barmak put much more meaning into his film than just using empty long takes, with low-key lighting. The oppression shown by the Taliban highlights the reality of life under their regime. During an trial and execution scene, the judge is seen playing with a necklace of beads. He decides to execute a white journalist after seeing footage of what he had filmed with a camera, highlighting the cruelty of the Taliban. This ties back to the beginning. The film begins with a walk through the streets of Kabul. There is a begging child. As the camera goes through the streets of Kabul, a massive protest by women, covered head to toe in a burqa, is seen. This footage from the beginning of the film is what is shown to the Taliban’s judge. Barmak uses this to highlight the way in which women were suppressed, and the irony that any information about this was blocked from the outside.
</p>
	<p class="bodytext">Although “Osama” was a poor quality film, with a low budget, it highlighted a lot of the culture of the Taliban. Barmak was able to bring out the cruelty, and the reality of life under the Taliban, with relatively low cost, and authentic actors from the streets of Kabul, many of whom lived under the Taliban.

	<h1>Art Analysis</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p class="bodytext">This piece catches the eye because of the white used, with some areas highlighted to give the effect of a bright light shining from the right. A viewer’s immediate reaction may be to question the amount of light in the background, behind the man, woman, and child. They may be attracted to the contrast between the woman’s white burqa and the man’s black clothes, whose black colour stands out, in opposition, to the pure white painting. The composition is built to have the light shining from the right, with people surrounded by a sea of doves, a symbol of peace. This may trigger a response from the viewer that the painting is about the delicacy of peace, symbolized by the white clothed woman, and the numerous doves. 
	</p><p class="bodytext">Looking closely at the doves, the brush strokes can be noticed; the heads on some doves are not perfectly round, but rather drawn out in a series of lines, designed delicately enough to make it seem round. This design imperfectness can express reality, and also the idea that although we are imperfect, we can still come together to make peace.  The painting also expresses deep contour lines and texture of the woman’s burqa, which can be vividly seen, with contrasts in colour. This differs from the man, who’s shape and colour is blurred to the point where it is hard to distinguish what the figure is. The watercolour also allows for a very light coloured painting, focusing more on whiter colours such as light blue or white, rather than darker, more opaque, colours.  Even the darker coloured figure in the center is covered up by the boy and the woman, both wearing white. 
	</p><p class="bodytext">The artist, Rashed Rahmani is known for his use of light to portray Afghanistan. He experienced the horrors of the rule of the Taliban, and that is reflected in his art. The doves portrayed are a symbol of peace, overflowing, and living through the Taliban has caused Rahmani to yearn for a peaceful Afghanistan. This connects to the fact that Afghanistan has seen non stop violence for the past 40 years. Rahmani’s goal is to use art to express Afghanistan’s culture, and by drawing doves, a symbol important to Afghan culture today, it symbolizes peace and harmony, something that all Afghans yearn to achieve. Also, by depicting a woman in a burqa, the artist could also be referencing Afghanistan under Taliban rule, where all woman were forced to wear burqas. The message is that despite differences, despite the war, peace and harmony will still stand strong. This is portrayed by the light tone, and by the white composition of colours. The artist wants viewers to hope for  a peaceful Afghanistan.
